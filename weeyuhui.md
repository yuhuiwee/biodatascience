### Wee Yuhui


I am a CNYang student currently on exchange in Sweden. I enjoy playing cookie run and snacking in my free time. I also like to code and believe that Python is superior to R.

My project involves finding a gold standard in network alignment algorithms and testing current existing network algorithms to see if they meet the criteria.
